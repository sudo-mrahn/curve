These scripts compute and visualize the curve for a given set of scores. The recommended curve scheme meets the following criteria:
1. The curve strictly preserves order (i.e. given curve c, a < b implies c(a) < c(b))
2. The curve is a monotonically increasing function (i.e. the curve can only increase grades)
3. The minimum score after the curve is 50
4. Lower scores are curved proportionally more than higher scores
